If there is a number on that Hex it means that team number is attacking/defending that hex.
UI_AutoGen_188
If you see a flashing hex on the Raid Map it is being attacked. When a hex is being attacked a specific Defending team must jump in to defend it.
UI_AutoGen_189
Defenders:
UI_AutoGen_190
Initiate battles by choosing the hex they wish to strike.  Attackers must work from outside->in.  Attackers can only attack hexes adjacent to the one(s) they control.
UI_AutoGen_191
Attackers:
UI_AutoGen_192
If you are a defender the Hexes are blue, if attacker they are red.
UI_AutoGen_193
Each piece on the hex-board represents a facility owned by the Defending agency.
UI_AutoGen_194
Attackers are trying to take Center Base; Defenders are holding out until raid timer expires.
UI_AutoGen_195
The center objective determines who has control of the sector.  The attackers must capture the center objective in the map to gain control of that sector.  If all attacking teams control their sector before the Raid Clock time expires, the attackers win the raid.
UI_AutoGen_196
The objectives on the left and right of each map control a wall near the center objective for the map adjacent to you.  These walls limit the defenders access to the center objective for your neighbors.  If team 1 captures their left objective, a wall on the right side of the center objective in team 2's map rises out of the ground.
UI_AutoGen_197
Each team is assigned to attack/defend a location of the base.

Welcome to Dome City, Agent.  This is where we start over and the chance for liberty begins.
ui_volume_desc
Impossibly brilliant, charismatic, and inspiring, if not for all of the cybernetics that work tirelessly to keep him alive, Dalton Bancroft, benefactor of Dome City, has dedicated his life to bringing down the Commonwealth.  He leads a loose coalition of independent agencies called the Allied Revolutionary Militia (A.R.M.). His personal agency, Agency Zero, liberates scientists, mercenaries, and innocents from Commonwealth control.

(She speaks into her headset) Can you hear me?  You should keep moving. (Ava finally sees you).  I'll be right with you, I'm helping another Agent escape.
ui_volume_desc
Ava stands surrounded by flashing screens full of text and maps that she uses to coordinate drops and missions for Agency Zero and any unified A.R.M. activity.  She multitasks in a way that makes multi-core processors jealous.  It seems an impossible amount of information for one person to handle but Ava maneuvers it with nonchalance.

I'm a bit busy at the moment - contemplating things that would make you hemorrhage.  Haven't you got something to blow up?
ui_volume_desc
A crisp and formal graduate of Cambridge, and a master of genetic studies, Dr. Simon LeRonge was sentenced to life imprisonment for discovering a genetic mutation in infants of 3rd world regions.  His further studies indicated that this mutation was engineered and spread among these "lesser" people in order to remove the lowest denominator from the Commonwealth.  LeRonge was rescued by Agency Zero, but struggles against the violent and terroristic tactics of Bancroft.

Landers stands with a confidence devoid of arrogance. Through hardship he has earned everything he has ever gained and it shows plainly on his weathered face and calloused hands. His mere presence wordlessly commands the respect of his peers.

Do you have a sister?  Does she like to video chat?
ui_volume_desc
Social awkwardness is defined by young men like Yuri. A brilliant student of marine mechanical engineering, Yuri was arrested for cyber crimes of an illicit nature but now chooses the life of a Junker. He hovers next to a collection of computer parts. For no apparent reason he routinely avoids eye contact.

Hitch
ui_volume_name
A fine mustache's the way to get a lady talking to ya.  Fine music's the way to properly drone her out.
ui_volume_desc
Hitch takes pride in two things - his music and his moustache.  He curls the end of his prized facial art in anxiety and sweats profusely in the desert heat. A wrench and an oily rag dangle from his back pocket. He doesn't seem to be listening to music and that means something is definitely wrong.

ui_volume_desc
Crouching over a small pile of Recursive Scavenger parts, Ozwald keeps shaking his head and muttering calculations to himself.  Formerly a prominent figure in robotics engineering, Ozwald was ejected from the Commonwealth for researching androids after it was deemed illegal to do so. Shock white hair belies his age though his body is muscular and leathered by the desert sun.

Dr. Andrei Bolonov
ui_volume_name
Are you CRAZY person?  You draw them to me like bees to honey!
ui_volume_desc
Stripped down to his small clothes, the gaunt figure of Dr. Andrei Bolonov is laid bare.  He seems unperturbed by his lack of clothing or severely growing sunburn, but is instead fixated upon the Recursive Colony below. He grins with crooked teeth and unbridled eagerness. With a PHD in both genetics and behavioral medicine, Dr. Bolonov was a key contributor to the Agent Omega Program ten years ago.

Fierce as a bird of prey, Quarza's manner offers little in the way of pleasantry but instead bluntly and curtly cuts to the matter at hand. His chin is raised in proud, regal bearing, indicating his former status as the tribal chief of the Kanar. Ousted by the Legion, Quarza now rallies those that oppose the Warlord.  The stress of living this dual life is evident on his face.

Dr. Catheryn Ives has definitely looked better. One eye is swollen and bruised, her bottom lip still bleeds openly, and her clothing is battered and torn from the continued rough treatment.  Despite this, an intelligent defiance glitters in her eyes, a brazen sense of righteousness to set the world on the correct path. As a PHD in human genetic growth and development, Dr. Ives was a key contributor to the Agent Omega Program ten years ago.

ui_volume_desc
Hitch takes pride in two things - his music and his mustache.  He curls the end of his prized facial art in anxiety and sweats profusely in the desert heat. A wrench and an oily rag dangle from his back pocket. He doesn't seem to be listening to music and that means something is definitely wrong.

If your territories are not connected to your HQ, those territories will incur a 50% production penalty.

Some territories have a bonus towards production for specific facility types.
UI_Facility_ProdTip_2
Facilities gain a 5% bonus for each adjacent territory that contains a similar facility type, up to 30%.

The more territories you own, the less efficient each territory becomes.  Owning more than 5 territories results in all of your territories becoming less efficient.  Generally, the most efficient agency will hold around 13 territories.

Wait a second, I'm getting another signal.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Breakout_010
It looks like one more managed to disconnect.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Breakout_020
If you can hear me, you've somehow managed to escape your stasis chamber.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Breakout_030
You need to get moving. Head up the ramp and towards the door to get out of the laboratory. You should see a trail of arrows guiding you to your destination.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Breakout_050
Keep moving, we need to find you an exit off of that building.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Breakout_070
You're doing great. Use the service elevator up ahead.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Elevator_010
There should be a jetpack station nearby.  Head to the station and pick up a jetpack.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Elevator_020
You'll notice a blue power inidcator in the top left of your field of vision.  This is the status of your device power for guns, stealth, jetpacks, everything.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Jetpack_010
You should be in a supply room, you'd better arm yourself with anything you can find.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Equip_010
Wherever you look, you'll notice that the center of your field of view is marked by an aiming reticule.  This is intended to help you be more accurate with weapons fire, so try to line up your shots inside of it.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Rifle_010
You're doing great.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Rifle_020
We're intercepting reports that more security forces are on their way, so you'd better keep moving.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Rifle_030
If you start taking too much damage, find a safe place out of sight and use your Rapid Epidermal Synthesizing Tool, or REST device. It's another implant they put in you, which will repair any minor damage you sustain. While using your rest device your power pool won't regenerate, and you are more vulnerable, so be sure to take cover first.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Rest_010
Before you pass through that shimmering field in front of you, you should know that it's a mono-magnetic barrier, which is a fancy way of saying it's a one-way door. The Commonwealth usually puts these things in buildings where security drones are active as a safeguard. Get ready for a fight before you pass through it!
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Forcefield_010
I don't know how you beat that thing, but great work! There's a train coming by, see if you can use it to travel to the edge of the city.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Forcefield_020
You're on the roof of one of the city's armories. You're going to have to travel by jetpack the rest of the way... If you can survive this, you'll be ready for anything else they throw at you.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_Lockhart_Train_020
When you use an off-hand device, it recharges slowly over time using it's own generator, so it won't pull from your power pool.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_Lockhart_Offhand_010
You're not going to survive long up on the roof; you need to find a way into that facility. It'll be much safer and maybe you can find something to wear.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_Lockhart_Offhand_020
That's strange... I'm not picking up any readings from the area ahead. Maybe we got lucky here and the security drone is down for repairs.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_Lockhart_Offhand_040
Our up-link cut out again as soon as you went in there. You'll have to tell me what happened later, because it's time to finally get out of the city.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Underground_010
We won't be able to land anywhere in its borders, but you can escape through the sewers if you can find an access hatch.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Underground_020
Once you're down there, head south and you'll come across one of Agency Zero's old bases. We had to abandon it years ago, but you should be able to activate one of our emergency escape routes.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Underground_030
You're almost there, just follow this tunnel and you should find the base.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Underground_040
That's it, there's the emergency escape access panel. It looks like those Commonwealth stiffs were never quite able to crack it. Access the terminal, and it will guide you to the escape tunnel.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Terminal_010
There, the way is clear for you now. Just a short run and you're out of the city. We'll meet you at the end of the tunnel.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_Lockhart_Terminal_020
You're a hard one to catch up with.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_AgentTaunt_02
Recovering faster than they expected, too, but not fast enough.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_AgentTaunt_03
You've skipped your re-education, been exposed to an uncontrolled environment, and so there is no going back I'm afraid.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_AgentTaunt_04
You've squandered your chance to serve the Commonwealth. Your chance to replace... me.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_AgentTaunt_05
I do hope you understand that you were very valuable to the Commonwealth; I will not enjoy destroying you.
VOX_Intro_Skylark_AgentTaunt_01
Welcome aboard, Agent. We'll be at Dome City in a few hours. I think you're gonna do well there.
VOX_Intro_AgencyZero_GruffAgent_Underground_010
It's a dead-end... You're going to have to jump off the roof - don't worry, you've got the Jetpack. There is another rooftop just below your current location.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Escape_010
You need to hurry up.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Hurry_010
You should keep moving.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Hurry_020
We need to get you out of there, keep going.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Hurry_030
Standing around won't get you out of there, hurry up.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Hurry_040
When you are ready, attack and destroy the Android at the door.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Ready_010
Just keep rotating that frequency and we'll be fine. Okay, sorry about that. Good, you're still there. You should take a moment to catch your breath.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Pursuit_010
It looks like you're in an equipment area. You can use your Equipment Manager to see if there is a ranged weapon available for you to use.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Screen_010
Melee weapons can come in handy when you're running low on energy or when your enemies are too close for comfort.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Melee_010
Hitting your target from behind will inflict significantly more damage.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Block_010
You can block with a melee weapon, but keep in mind you can only block other melee attacks and not ranged attacks.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Block_015
It's a good thing you're a fast learner, because you need to get moving again.
VOX_Intro_Inception_Lockhart_Block_020
Watch your back - Androids responding to the alarm could be teleported to any location
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Block_030
Try to keep one eye behind you at all times.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Block_040
Using your Jetpack will help you to travel a great deal faster. As you can guess, covering distance quickly is important when using a melee weapon.
VOX_Intro_Adrenaline_Lockhart_Block_050

God of the Sky
BOT_desc
King of Gods, Zeus strives for fairness and justice, but will not hesitate to call down the thunder when there's smiting to be done!\n\nZeus' father, the Titan Cronus, immediately swallowed his children after birth so that none could overthrow him as he had his own father. When Zeus was born, Rhea, Zeus' mother, hid the child from Cronus and gave the Titan a rock in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed instead. In secret, Zeus grew up on the isle of Crete until he was old and strong enough to challenge his father. During their battle, Zeus slit open Cronus' stomach, allowing his swallowed brothers and sisters to escape, slaying the Titan. Then, Zeus released the Cyclops and other beings Cronus had kept imprisoned. In gratitude, the Cyclops awarded Zeus control over lightning.\n\nWith his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, the three Gods drew lots to decide command of creation. Poseidon became king of the sea, Hades the underworld, and Zeus the sky. From his golden throne atop Mount Olympus, Zeus now rules Gods and Men with his wife Hera, upholding justice, hospitality, oaths, and honesty to all under his domain.\n\nYet, Zeus is a restless God, and while he holds high expectations for others, he does not keep those standards for himself. Chiefly, Zeus is nearly infamous for several infidelities to his wife which have resulted in dozens of children beget by other women, most famous of which are Hercules, Artemis, and Athena. Such wanton unfaithfulness is the source of great jealousy from Hera, though as King, Zeus can ultimately do as he wishes.\n\nWeather is dictated by the Thunder God's mood. When in a fair temperament, the sky is clear, bright and warm. When Zeus' anger flares, black clouds roll in, lightning streaks the sky and thunder shakes the very ground. Lately, Zeus has been furious.

God of the Yellow River
BOT_desc
As God of the Yellow River, He-Bo tamed the massive and turbulent waters with humility and sacrifice. Now, the forces of the great river are at his command!\n\nThroughout history, no river has been the source of more nourishment or more destruction than China's Yellow River. Its basin valley was the cradle that birthed Chinese civilization, feeding fields with water and millions of tons of collected sediments, which give the river its yellow hue. The river is also treacherous and prone to flooding, destroying shoreline settlements and drowning thousands.\n\nLong ago, Feng Yi, a mortal man living along the riverside, watched in dismay as a storm stirred the waters and gorged the banks. It would not be long before the mighty river consumed his village. Both humble and wise, Feng Yi tied rocks to his belt before casting himself into the waters. This act of sacrifice did more than appease the angry river, it promoted Feng Yi to Godhood over it. Thus, he became He Bo.\n\nMuch time passed, and He Bo grew proud of his great river, so proud that he declared the Yellow River the biggest body of water anywhere. A passerby asked if He Bo had seen the North Sea, but He Bo dismissed the comment, for heavy rains were falling and the river was roaring and full. As time wore on, thought of the North Sea tickled his mind, so he made the journey. There, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea warmly met him.  Viewing the endless expanse of water, He Bo was humbled and returned to his River wiser.\n\nFor He Bo, there are no greater virtues than wisdom and humility. With the force of the Yellow River at his command, He Bo will remind his enemies what it means to be humble.

the Howler Monkey God
BOT_desc
A grudge, like any wound, left untended will fester.\n\nHun Batz and his twin brother Hun Chouen, led a contented life with their grandmother. Artists and musicians, everything they created was beautiful and enchanting, but they lacked their father's talent for the ball game, Pitz. Summoned to the underworld, their father, Hun Hunapu never returned. Instead his new offspring, half-brothers to Hun Batz and Hun Chauen, appeared. The Hero Twins were everything the original twins were not, strong, athletic, and clever. And they were extremely gifted at playing Pitz.\n\nA jealous rivalry formed between the two sets of twins. The more they played ball together, the more Hun Batz and his brother were defeated. Eventually, the original twins resorted to foul tricks, aggressive tactics, and out-right cheating. Frustrated with these antics, the Hero Twins kicked the ball into a tree, knowing Hun Batz and his brother considered themselves excellent climbers and would go after it. Yet, the higher they climbed, the taller the tree grew, until they could not get back down. Pleased with their magic thus far, The Hero Twins encouraged Hun Batz and Hun Chouen to use their belts like tails in order to escape the terrible height. However, upon doing so, they were mysteriously and humiliatingly transformed into monkeys.\n\nThough the Monkey Twins, as they are now called, came to be worshipped as Gods of Art and Music, the animosity they hold for the Hero Twins remains. Time has only sharpened their combined cunning, and they eagerly await a chance to strike back. Like any wound, their grudge has festered, and what was once a brotherly rivalry has grown into a far more deadly game.

DEVICE_name
Reveling in the joys of life, Bastet, daughter of Ra, is the sensual embodiment of her feline form. This cat, however,  has the fiercest claws.\n\nCats are creatures that demand worship. They are regal, nonchalant, and insatiable. Though, as much as they languish in the sun and rumble with purrs of pleasure, cats are agile and deadly hunters. Mercilessly, they cull the populations of invasive vermin and stinging scorpions, protecting the home from vile invaders. Perhaps, the most troublesome enemy of the cat is the serpent, and there was no greater snake in the world than the horrendous Apep.\n\nCircling the world along the horizon line, Apep's scaly girth waited in ambush each morning for Ra to rise and bring light to the world. To fend off this beast, Ra kept the company of his daughter, Bastet. Since time began, as Ra lifted into the Eastern sky, Bastet would spit and howl, claws bared against the treacherous Apep. Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.\n\nWith her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases. Now, she is the guardian of home and hearth,  idol to women - especially those desiring children and exploring their sensuality - and patron of arts, wine, and any occasion of revelry. Like any cat, though, Bastet can still pounce without warning, shredding her enemies once her claws come out.

Combat Tutorial
MSG_TUTORIAL_COMBAT_ACTIVATED
There are many Gods to choose from in SMITE, but for this tutorial, you will control the Egyptian God of Death, Anubis.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_1
There are greater goals in an actual SMITE match, but for now, let us practice basic movement and combat controls.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_2
SMITE uses standard FPS controls.  You can move your God around the map using the W,A,S,D keys.  Moving the mouse will look around and allow you to change your orientation.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_3
Use W,A,S,D and the mouse to move Anubis to each of the five glyphs.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_4
Move Anubis to each of the remaining glyphs.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_5
Very Good. 4 glyphs remain.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_6
Excellent. 3 glyphs remain.
UI_Tutorial_Basic_7
2 glyphs remain.

God of the Nile
BOT_desc
Hunter, guardian, destroyer, menace; the Crocodile God, Sobek, swims where the Nile takes him and owes allegiance to no one.\n\nSome say that Sobek was there when only the Dark Waters existed, so he helped create the world. Some say that Sobek made the Nile with his sweat and protects those that travel it if they pay him tribute, otherwise he destroys them. Some say that Sobek ushers the worthy dead down the Nile to the afterlife and aids in their rebirth, restoring sight and strength. Some say he is evil and hateful, ravaging those along the shores and terrorizing villages. Sobek, in truth, is all of these things and none.\n\nSobek is not a God of good or evil, of benevolence or malice, but a God of solitary neutrality, unless disturbed; a God that tends to his mighty river and performs his responsibilities to passing souls. The rest of the time, he does what he wishes. For his protection to the living and the dead, he is to be worshipped and respected. For his power, ferocity, and ruthlessness, he is to be rightfully feared.

There are few elements as destructive or as purifying as fire. Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\n\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\n\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\n\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash.

Jackal-headed Anubis holds the ultimate judgment over the dead, measuring every heart against the weight of Truth.\n\nNephthys, wife of Set - the God of Darkness, desired a child, yet her husband was infertile, so Nephthys disguised herself as Isis, the wife of Set's brother Osiris, and seduced him. From that union, Anubis was born. Osiris cared for Anubis as his own, but when Osiris was murdered by his evil brother, Set, Anubis embalmed his adopted father and mummified the corpse so he would not rot. This preservation passed down to the Faithful, for if it was good enough for the Gods, it was good enough for man.\n\nNone enter the abyss of the Underworld without first being tested by Anubis. When corpses are preserved, he is the embalmer. When time for judgment comes, he is the final arbiter. In his realm, he keeps legendary weighing scales. On one side, the massive weight of Ma'at 
  truth and order. On the other side, he places the heart of the deceased. Should the weight of Ma'at prove infinitely heavier than that of the heart, Anubis casts the soul deep into the darkness of the Underworld, where it is forgotten, never to be reborn.

Once, a beautiful and talented weaver of cloth and fabric, a single prideful mistake made a monster of Arachne for all time.\n\nWith loom and thread, there were none more skilled than the mortal Arachne. Viewers traveled leagues just to see her art. So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.\n\nWhen Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.\n\nThey both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne's weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight. Violently, she tore Arachne's tapestry and pressed a finger to Arachne's forehead. Twisting in anguish, Arachne fell to the ground as additional legs grew from her body, screaming as she transformed into the first spider.\n\nIt was an act of anger and pity, a lesson and a curse, for spiders are the greatest of weavers, and Arachne, in particular, was to weave for all time, but none could doubt the consequence for Arachne's pride. Still, within her twisted heart, Arachne never forgave Athena, consumed by a dark hatred that can be sated only by the destruction of the Gods.

Inevitably, death sends everyone to Hades, God of the Underworld. In the end, he always gets his way.\n\nEldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, Hades was swallowed by his father as an infant along with five other siblings. Zeus, the youngest brother, escaped this fate and freed them once he'd grown strong enough to battle Cronus. Together, the six siblings defeated the Titans and banished them to the dark realm of Tartarus. Now the reigning Gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades drew lots for dominion. Hades drew the Underworld.\n\nOf the few that have entered the Underworld and come back, all speak dismally of the place, never wishing to return. Yet Hades, himself, rarely leaves the subterranean realm, constantly seeking ways to grow the numbers of the dead.\n\nWhen he desired a wife, Hades captured the radiant Persephone, daughter of the Goddess Demeter. Concealed in the Underworld, none could reach her, so Demeter cursed the land with a great famine. The other Gods pleaded with her to end it lest she destroy mankind, but she would not relent until her daughter was returned. Hades finally let Persephone leave, though not before feeding her pomegranate seeds. Having consumed the fruit, she was bound forever to Hades and required to return to her husband once per year to eat of the seeds again. This, it is said, is a time of mourning and the cause of winter.\n\nWhile many fear death and view it as evil, in truth, Hades endeavors only to keep balance. He is stern but fair. As God of the Dead and the Underworld, he views his authority on this matter absolute, forbidding anyone to leave his realm and growing wrathful when disobeyed or when someone tries to cheat death or steal from him.\n\nFor everyone, death is unavoidable and service to Hades inevitable. Even the Gods.

To speak of Kali is to speak of the beginning of time itself.\n\nAcross the majestic lands of Hindustan rose an army of demons that conquered the countryside and slaughtered the people. Yet, when the Gods themselves were defeated, Devi, the supreme Goddess, emerged to throw back this host and protect the faithful.\n\nThree forms she took during these ancient times. The first, Durga, the Mother of Creation, was as radiant as she was fearsome. Astride her tiger, she scattered the demon horde until she encountered the horrendous Raktabija. For each wound she gave the demon, his cursed blood created a copy, quickly resulting in an unstoppable army of Raktabija clones. Rage boiled at the corners of Durga's mind, in the quest to slaughter and destroy evil.  From the forehead of Durga sprung her wrathful form, with skin darkened and eyes glowing a menacing red.\n\nThus was Kali, the Black One, Goddess of Time and Destruction, the second form of Devi born.\n\nRarely has Kali been seen since, kept in the shadows of Devi's mind, but when the tides of battle shift and evil looms large, there is no solution but unrestrained destruction of evil, and Kali once again, walks the Earth.

Mightiest of the Aesir, warrior and king, the All-Father is a doomed God.\n\nIt seems strange to imagine a God concerned with his fate, but Odin regularly consults the volva, the seers in the North. They speak of a final war, Ragnarok, when the mightiest Gods are slain and the world is consumed by the sea. For this day, Odin constantly prepares.\n\nThe All-Father can trace his lineage to the evil Frost Giant, Ymir, whom he slew with the aid of his two brothers, Vili and Ve, and with his remains forged the world. Atop Asgard, where Odin presides, he is known as the bringer of war, a sage of wisdom, and the keeper of souls slain in battle.\n\nAs a warrior, Odin rides his eight legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir. Accompanying him are two wolves and his two trusted ravens, Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who fly around Midgard and return to Odin with all they see and hear.\n\nAs a sage, Odin travels disguised as a simple wanderer, seeking wisdom. His thirst for knowledge has come at great personal cost, having been hanged from the branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree, for nine days and nights and sacrificed one of his eyes to the Well of Wisdom.\n\nAs keeper of souls, Odin welcomes slain warriors to his mighty hall of Valhalla on the agreement they will aid him at Ragnarok. Favored female warriors become his elite Valkyrie that usher those worthy of entry to Valhalla.\n\nIt is in preparation for the final days of Ragnarok he does all this. For the seers claim his death will come at the fangs of the great wolf Fenrir, and like anyone, Odin seeks to change his fate. Yet, never once have the volva been mistaken.

Without the sun, there would be no light, no warmth, no life. Without Ra, there would be no sun.\n\nRa is a guardian, the keeper of Ma'at - order and truth, and master of the sun. Each day he sails across the sky in a golden ship, and each night traverses the underworld, bringing light and warmth to the dead beneath the horizon. For those in the scorched South, Ra was the first God, creator of earth and sky and father to all other Gods.\n\nBut Ra's time is fading like a twilight sky. His descendants have grown in power and prominence and seek to replace him as the figure of authority. His own granddaughter, Isis, cleverly poisoned him by secretly summoning a viper under his units. When he stepped on it, the serpent's venomous bite poisoned him. Isis promised to heal Ra if he revealed to her his True Name. At first, he refused, for knowledge of his True Name would give Isis unparalleled power over him, but as the pain mounted, Ra was forced to relent. Isis kept her word and Ra was healed, though the cost may have been too high.\n\nLight can heal, but light can also burn, and the great protector is showing signs of wrath not seen since mankind's insolence. In that rare moment of anger, Ra sent his daughter, Hathor, in the form of a lion, to devour the people. However, he ended her bloody feeding before she consumed all mankind. This time, his burning gaze is set on the other Gods. When his wrath finally cools, nothing may be left but ash.

Though small of stature, Vamana, the Fifth Avatar of Vishnu, should never be underestimated. His harsh lessons in humility have shamed even the proudest of kings.\n\nThe demon king, Bali, was fair and righteous, yet for all his virtues, Bali was extremely proud and driven by fierce ambition. After conquering the Underworld and all the Earth, Bali managed to wrest the Heavens from the God Indra. Unable to reclaim his seat, Indra implored Vishnu for aid, and so Vishnu took the form of a small mortal man, a priest named Vamana.\n\nIn his splendid palace, Bali was giving gifts to the pious. Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali's demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali's benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali's sacrifice.\n\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson. Even the mightiest and most arrogant of kings can be humbled by the smallest of men.

As far as it is known, Ymir has long been dead.\n\nIn Midgard, in the North, it is believed that Ymir's skull is the sky, his flesh the earth, and his blood the sea. Though, these claims could merely be the boasting of proud Odin and his brothers, who take credit for slaying the first jotunn and fashioning the earth from his body parts.\n\nAt the beginning of time, the Realm of Fire, Muspell, and the Realm of Ice, Niflheim met at the place called Ginnungagap; the void of space. Steam rose and froze again, and from that primordial mixture, Ymir, King of the Frost Giants took shape. From his body dripped other beings that would become the ancestors of Gods, Men, Dwarves, and of course, Giants. Even the mighty Odin must claim Ymir as his grandfather. Yet Ymir, like all giants, was an evil creature and led his Giant brethren against the Gods. After ages of warfare, Odin and his brothers slew the Giant-King and forged the world from his remains.\n\nYet there are other whispers. Rumors that Ymir, though not a God, was still a Primeval Being, and as such cannot truly be destroyed. Perhaps he only lies dormant in Niflheim, the realm of ice, eager to return and wreak vengeance upon Odin in his kin.

Anhur, the lion-headed Egyptian God of war, slays his enemies with spear and guile. Weapons equally as sharp!\n\nAs a son of Ra, Anhur, and his sister Bastet, rode in the golden barge their father sailed across the sky each day. They protected the ship at dawn and dusk from the world serpent, Apep, who lurked at the horizon. Courageous, formidable, and above all, intelligent, Anhur defended the vessel with his spear and wits, outsmarting and distracting the serpent until feral Bastet delivered a killing blow.  With Apep gone, Ra became Pharaoh, Bastet, the Goddess of Cats and Women, and Anhur donned the mantle of the God of War.  This is how he became known as the Slayer of Enemies.\n\nAs time went on, another feline Goddess, Menhet, ran away from the Pantheon, spurning Ra. Anhur vowed to bring her back from the distant lands of Nubia to appease his father, but when he finally caught up with Menhet, he was enraptured and fell in love. He tied a rope to her neck and led her home, where he requested Menhet become his wife, a boon Ra happily granted.\n\nFor Egyptians, warfare is more than bloody battle, it's a means to break the chains of tyranny. Anhur can be found at the head of any charge, crushing corruption and leading the people to freedom. While his spear is deadly, Anhur is cunning and clever, able to outmaneuver opponents in ways they least expect.

As a man, Guan Yu was the embodiment of loyalty, honor, and strength. As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\n\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\n\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei's fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao's gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao's retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\n\nAfter his death, Guan Yu's spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\n\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory. Among the Gods of any Pantheon, there are few as deadly and none as righteous as Guan Yu.

A horrendous demon with a bottomless appetite for human flesh, Bakasura is a nightmare come to life.\n\nAfter committing countless atrocities, Bakasura has demonstrated no end to his depravity, no limits to his brutality, no sating his desire to slurp human meat, crunch bone, and guzzle hot blood. So many are his vile victories over mankind that they cannot be relayed here, yet it his defeat at the hands of a man that is worth the telling.\n\nAccording to the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, the famous Pandava brothers were traveling in exile with their mother, Kunti, when they came to the village Ekachakra. Disguised as brahmins, they sought alms from the villagers in order to sustain themselves. They soon learned that a demon, Bakasura, was living outside the village, devouring the people as they passed through the woods. The chief went to the demon and begged that the feasting stop. In return, a cart of food would be sent to Bakasura each day. Bakasura consumed not only the provisions, but the person that brought the cart as well.\n\nAfter hearing this tale from a weeping woman whose son would bear the cart on the morrow, Kunti declared that her son Bhima, who possessed impossible strength and had slain demons before, would take the cart instead, as repayment to the kindness the villagers had shown their family.\n\nOnce in the forest, Bhima nonchalantly ate the food intended for Bakasura. Furious, Bakasura threatened to eat Bhima, which he just laughed off, goading the demon to attack him. All day they battled until Bhima finally slew the demon, tied him to the cart and dragged the body back to the village, where the people celebrated the victory in bewilderment.\n\nHunger, however, is a demon that cannot be defeated and, inevitably, Bakasura's disgusting rumble will rise again, now more ravenous than ever and ready to feed.

An arrow from the bow of Cupid, chubby little God of Love, will make anyone give in to passion and desire.\n\nCupid, as he was called by the Romans, is the son of Venus and Mars, or Aphrodite and Ares as they were known by the Greeks. He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid's steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\n\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid's invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\n\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid's arrows and fell in love with him.\n\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together. Thus, Cupid fed Psyche the drink of ambrosia that made her immortal and the God of love got to live happily ever after.

Armed with a magical bow, Artemis is the unrivaled Goddess of the Hunt!\n\nDaughter of Zeus and Leta, Artemis and her twin brother Apollo are products of Zeus' infidelity to his wife Hera. Insulted, Hera cursed Leta while she was pregnant, forbidding her to give birth on land or sea. Fortunately, she found an island that did not touch the ocean floor, so it was neither land nor sea, and thus bore her children. Artemis was born first, then miraculously aided as midwife in the birthing of her brother.\n\nArtemis spent her childhood in the hills and forests, training with her bow and hunting beasts. As she grew older and more beautiful, she also grew proud and ruthless when slighted or dishonored, especially against those that claimed to be better hunters than she. Adonis boasted this very thing and Artemis sent a wild boar to skewer him. The twin demigods Otos and Ephialtes, who could not be killed except by each other, threatened to kidnap Artemis and force her to marry one of them, but were tricked when Artemis, appearing as a doe, dashed between them. As they thrust with their spears they impaled each other. Finally, Actaeon, after peeping at Artemis while she bathed, was transformed into a stag and devoured by his own hunting dogs. Such is the wrath of Artemis.\n\nHer name is invoked by hunters seeking prey and by midwives during childbirth. Sacrifices are made in her name before a new military campaign. Adolescent girls are sent to her shrine to serve for one year. Beautiful, deadly, and chaste, Artemis is a focused woman and a fearsome warrior.

Thor, as famous as he is bold, is God of the thundering sky. Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\n\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor's enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor's near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\n\nSif, Thor's wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\n\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki's fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\n\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day. With Mjolnir in hand, Thor is an unstoppable force that even other Gods would do well to avoid.

God of War
BOT_desc
Feared by his enemies, reviled by his father, adored by the Goddess of Beauty, and worshipped by warriors, Ares, a tortured and lonely soul, is the bloodthirsty Greek God of War.\n\nAres is not loved by the people. He represents everything they fear and despise: war, strife, chaos, and murder. It's said that the sky darkens when Ares takes the field. That he rides to battle on a chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds and delights only in the clash of battle and smell of bloodshed.\n\nAres is not loved by his father. Zeus has many sons, but only two with his wife Hera. However, the thunder God has long suspected Hera of having an affair that led to the birth of Ares, perhaps as revenge for all of Zeus' infidelity. For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.\n\nAres is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives. Often they have been on the opposite sides, most notably at the Battle of Troy, where Athena viciously wounded him and forced Ares to retreat.\n\nAres is the lover of the Goddess of Beauty. Though Aphrodite is married to Ares' brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.\n\nAres is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds. The Spartans, however, know the unpredictable fury of their patron, and bind his statues in chains. This is, in part, to prevent Ares' spirit of victory from escaping Sparta, and a vain effort to keep the God of War contained.

Valkyries, the elite and angelic warriors of the Nordic Pantheon, are as beautiful and dangerous as a midnight winter storm. Yet their queen, Freya, so irresistibly desirable, so uncompromising in warfare, make the Valkyries seem nothing more than plain paper dolls. She's the object of desire for every God, every man, and the envy of every woman. Even the Frost Giants crave her for their own, often devising devious plans to trick or force her into marriage. But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.\n\nWere it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades. Her name literally means 
 the lady,
  and none of more worthy of the title. She adores bright flowers, pleasant company, and the sweet lilt of a sad love song. She's sensual and amorous, invoked by worshipers seeking to bear a child or find a lover. Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.\n\nOnce, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster. Melancholy but loyal, she stayed and comforted him. Though one night, while she slept, a daring hunter slew the beast Od had become. Moved by Freya's utter despair, the Gods agreed to allow Od into Sussrumnir, despite the fact he had not died in battle, so he and Freya could remain together forever.

The Trickster God
BOT_desc
Villain. It's a word used to describe those that break the rules, that take what they want, and care nothing for those hurt along the way. Loki, the trickster God, would say villainy is nothing more than a point of view.\n\nThe point of view of fools too mindless to seize opportunity.\n\nOf course, with Loki now on the loose, the implications are dire. The end of times may be at hand. The final battle, Ragnarok, possibly on the horizon, for it was foretold that Loki would break free of his prison and herald the horrific final battle that would leave the Gods slain, the heavens sundered, and the world in ashes. None are more eager for that time of chaos than Loki.\n\nBefore his confinement, Loki's malicious mischief managed to affect every God in ways both beneficial and terrible. Yet Loki's most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\n\nBaldr's prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg, forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr's brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone's horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\n\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki's wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\n\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc. If the prophetic Volva are correct, and they always are, then the end of all things has finally come.

God of Wine
BOT_desc
Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may die. None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\n\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He's journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the 
 Mysteries of the Vine,
  a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\n\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the 
 gift.
  Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\n\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane.

BOT_name
the Unbound
BOT_desc
Mortals must rely on the wisdom of the Gods, but never forget they are fallible. They can be petty, churlish, and worst of all, wrong. What are the consequences for their mistakes? They should have slain the wolf-beast Fenrir, but they chose instead to bind him. Despite the warnings and prophecies he would tear Odin apart at Ragnorok and devour the earth and sky, they did not end Loki's son. Now, terror roams free. It is unknown how, but Fenrir is Unbound.\n\nThrice they tried to bind him, each time convincing Fenrir that the chains were nothing more than a challenge for his strength, a test to see if he could shatter them. The first two God-forged fetters were easily broken beneath the beast's terrible power, but the third was a ribbon, dwarf made, and Fenrir grew suspicious of the God's intentions. As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir's maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf's leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr's hand.\n\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory. But they were all warned and the Gods did nothing. Fenrir is hungry now, the first hunter, an alpha among sheep, but no flesh will satisfy his need. It is revenge he craves, and now he is Unbound.

Brave Hercules, a demigod son of Jupiter, born with impossible strength and force of will; for whom no task is insurmountable, no heroic deed unachievable. Yet, Like all of Jupiter's illegitimate children, Hercules once drew the ire of Juno, and though he is now known as a hero, his greatest achievements might never have been done without Juno's initial tragic involvement.\n\nShe struck Hercules mad, and he slew his own children.\n\nOnce recovered, grief stricken, Hercules sought penance for his crimes. An oracle of Jupiter advised he should pledge his service to the king Eurystheus, and so Hercules reluctantly did so. Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\n\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast's impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion's roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\n\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero's return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought.

Xbalanque was born with vengeance in his heart.\n\nAs one of the Hero Twins, Xbalanque, and his brother Hunahpu, knew their lives would eventually force them to face the Lords of Death, chiefs of the Underworld who murdered their father, but first they would need to master the arts of hunting with blowguns and the violent ball game Pitz.\n\nAs a test of their strength, they decided to defeat the vain and evil bird-lord, Seven Macaw, who declared himself the Sun and the Moon and replaced his teeth with glistening jewels.\n\nThe Hero Twins fired their blowguns at the perching bird-lord, knocking out several of Seven Macaw's glittering teeth. Ferociously he came at them, but only snatched Hunahpu and tore off the boy's arm. Cleverly, the twins enlisted the aid of an elderly couple and advised them to pose as dentists. Seven Macaw sought to ease the pain in his mouth, so, as they were instructed, the dentists pulled the rest of Seven Macaw's teeth and replaced them with white corn. So humiliated was the great bird that he died of despair.\n\nIt would be many years and several trials later that, at last, the Hero Twins were able to challenge the Lords of Death and avenge their father, but their final victory allowed them to ascend to the heavens, where Xbalanque was immortalized as the moon, lighting the night for clever hunters everywhere.

Father Chrishmash
ITEM_name
Both beautiful and terrible, the Goddess Hel is keeper of the dead, lays judgment on souls, and decides who is reborn. She is both sides of two extremes.\n\nAs the daughter of Loki, the trickster God, Hel's destiny, much like her brothers Fenrir and Jormungandr, was doomed to darkness from the start. Odin, the All-Father, uncovered prophecies that Hel and her siblings would be the source of great calamity resulting in Ragnar
k, the battle that would end all things. In an effort to prevent this, he cast each of the three into different realms; not quite a prison, though far from freedom. For Hel, Odin gave her charge of the realm of the dead, specifically those that died of sickness and old age. For himself, Odin retained Valhalla for those that died in battle.\n\nAt birth, Hel's face was cast half in shadow, half in light; she was both living and dead, so took immediately and graciously to her new role, gifting Odin with the ravens Huginn and Muninn in appreciation. As the spirits of the kind-hearted, the sick, the elderly were brought to her, she cared for them, gave them comfort, yet those she deemed evil she mercilessly hurled into the frozen depths of Niflheim.\n\nYet, despite Odin's efforts, destiny cannot be averted. Hel's conflicting struggle between benevolence and malice will force her to one extreme or the other. A time will come when Hel will fulfill her prophecy, though it is yet unknown if she will be a shadow of darkness or a force of light.

Smith of the Gods
BOT_desc
When the Gods of Rome ride chariots across the sky, it is Vulcan that made them. When they reach for weapons to wield in battle, it is Vulcan that forged them. When the very earth rumbles and mountains erupt in searing flame, it is Vulcan's rage that burns. Smith of the Gods, Vulcan crafts with fire and forge as an artist would with paint and brush.\n\nAs an infant, so hideous was Vulcan that his disgusted mother, Juno, cast him into the sea from the heights of Mount Olympus. So great was the fall, it smashed one of Vulcan's legs, a wound from which he would never recover.  Beneath the waves, a sea nymph, Thetis, rescued the child-god and raised him as her own. As Vulcan grew, he ventured to the surface and discovered fire and the art of smithing. His natural talents emerged and he forged wondrous jewels for his adopted mother.\n\nSummoned to a gala on Mount Olympus, Thetis wore Vulcan's glittering gifts, but when Juno discovered Vulcan had made them, she jealously demanded he return to Mount Olympus. Angrily, Vulcan refused. In his stead, he sent a magnificent throne of gold and gems that imprisoned Juno when she sat upon it.\n\nFor three days Juno was so entombed, and would have remained so had not Jupiter, Vulcan's father, interjected. To Vulcan he offered an exchange, Juno's freedom for the hand of Venus, the most beautiful Goddess of Love. Vulcan agreed.\n\nThough his vengeance was served cold, the fire of spite still burns in Vulcan's chest. Unable to truly forgive, he loses himself at the forge. None of the wondrous chariots, jewelry or weapons he crafts can ever fill the hurt in his heart, but each one is worthy of a God.

God of the Oceans
BOT_desc
Deep beneath the turbulent tides of the ocean lingers a God of idle rage. What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\n\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father's belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\n\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus' daughter. A competition was held 
  each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\n\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas.

Weaver of Fate
BOT_desc
When time began, there was only endless black waters. Yet, from water comes all life, and from this primordial force was born the first of Goddesses, Neith.\n\nAs the waters continued to form the world and everything within it, Neith's natural instinct to protect and nurture the people led her to champion the hunt. With meat she fed them and with hides she clothed them, but as the people she sought to protect grew old, or sick, or died on the battlefield, Neith's compassion forced her to change her calling.\n\nWith nimble fingers, the Goddess wove shrouds to shield the lost spirits of the dead on their journey to the underworld, leaving a loose thread she could trace as the ghosts ventured down the river. As time passed, more and more threads spread across the world, weaving an intricate pattern of fate that only Neith could see.\n\nNow, the war between Gods grows ever more fevered, and Neith can no longer sit idle. The threads of fate are fraying at the edges and she must once again pick up her bow and hunt, or watch the world return to the waters from whence it came.

There are too few words to describe the radiance, the magnificence, the inequitable glory of Aphrodite, Goddess of Beauty. So wondrous is she to behold that one look can inspire tears, desire, jealousy, and love. Yet, beneath her flawless exterior resides a heart burdened with insecurity.\n\nInattentive and hideous to look upon, her husband, Hephaestus, unknowingly leaves Aphrodite feeling lonely and worthless. She finds consolation in the arms of other men such as Ares, or validation by competing in any contest of beauty she encounters.\n\nAt a wedding attended by all the Gods, a golden apple appeared, inscribed with the words "to the fairest." Immediately Aphrodite, her mother Hera, and sister Athena quarreled over it. Zeus elected Paris, Prince of Troy, to choose a victor. In exchange for being named the fairest, Aphrodite offered any woman in the world as his wife, so Paris agreed. However, he chose Helen as his wife, and their love began the catastrophic Trojan War.\n\nNow, a new war brews, but this one between Gods, not men. While the battlefield is no place for the fairest of all, Aphrodite recalls the destruction between the Greeks and Trojans. Perhaps, this time, her beauty can be used to stop a war instead of start one. Perhaps, this time, she will discover the beauty within.

There are none without admiration for Apollo, God of Music. He is brash, cavalier, and dauntless, with the power to bring hope to the hopeless and change the course of battle with a single arrow. Voices of soldiers, mothers, kings and emperors, even Gods rise in glorious melody in honor of him; and he, basking in their adoration, shines victoriously.\n\nThough Hera, Queen of Gods, challenged his very birth, sending the great serpent Pylos to slay Apollo, his twin sister Artemis, and their mother Leto, not even she could deny him victory. Merely four days old, Apollo, gifted with a legendary bow, slew the Gaia Serpent and defied Hera.\n\nIn his humble youth, Apollo was a cattle herder. The trickster God Hermes stole Apollo's charges and led them to a nearby cave. From the shell of a tortoise and the body of a cow, he crafted the first Lyre. Apollo finally caught up with Hermes, saw the instrument, and simply had to have it, trading the rest of his cattle to Hermes for it. Years later, Hermes would send his son, Pan, to challenge Apollo in a contest of musical prowess, but Apollo soundly defeated the satyr with dexterous mastery of the Lyre.\n\nAs Apollo grew into his rightful place among the Gods, his victories mounted, and the songs of the Faithful were sung more and more in his name. Now, they raise their voices for Apollo to take the field as Gods clash. Never one to deny his adoring public, Apollo prepares for one last show.

Born to innocence, forced to fight, destined to be a hero, the child-god, Nezha, defends those that cannot defend themselves, especially against tyrant Gods.\n\nFor three and a half years, Nezha's mother carried him in her womb. During this time, the Dragon Gods, led by Ao Kuang, terrorized the people, sending floods and storms, and demanding not just food, but child sacrifices to feast upon as well.\n\nInto this world was Nezha born, a full grown boy with laughter in his eyes, trained by the immortal sage Taiyi Zhenren, who gave him the powerful Universe Ring and Armillary Sash. Youthful and carefree, Nezha was also headstrong, often arguing with his father what was right and wrong.\n\nBut youth does not last forever, and Nezha's life changed defending two friends against a captain of Ao Kuang's army. Insulted, the Dragon God commanded his third son, Ao Bing, to defeat the boy, but in the end, Nehza slew his opponent. Furious with grief, Ao Kuang demanded Nezha's father make reparations for the offense committed by his son, or he would send floods and storms to ravage the land. Nezha, humbly, sacrificed himself to appease the Dragon God, but evil Ao Kuang sent storms anyway.\n\nTaiyi Zhenren worked his wisdom, and from the petals of a Lotus plant, Nezha was reborn. The immortal sage gave him new weapons 
  the Fire Tipped Spear and Wind Fire Wheels 
  weapons to challenge even the Dragon God and defeat him once and for all.\n\nTime has passed since Ao Kuang's ruin, but the winds of war are rising and new Gods of Tyranny challenge the safety of the defenseless. Once again, Nezha will set aside his youth and stand against the tide, for not even death can stop him.

In war, there are two kinds of soldiers: those that fight for blood, and those that fight for honor. The first crave the clash of steel and smell of slaughter, the latter know the wisdom of justice, the kindness of mercy, and that life should never be taken wantonly. These different warriors seek different Gods. Ares, God of War revels in the bloodletting, but his sister, Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, is patron to those who fight with dignity, and only when there is no other alternative.\n\nFavored daughter of Zeus, wise as ten thousand scholars, just as the scales themselves; Athena is a paragon of incorruptible virtue, and worshipped with righteous fervor. So revered is she that Athens, greatest city in all the world, is named for her, and regal temples adorn the countryside in her honor, each tended by loyal priestesses. To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.\n\nAt the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans. Athena rose to stop him, indirectly championing the Greeks, but directly keeping the order of divine law. Their fierce battle clashed in unspeakable proportions, ending only when Ares limped from the battle field, cowed by his sister and rival. With Ares diminished, the tide of the war shifted and the heroes of the Greek Army toppled Troy.\n\nIn times of war, prayers are sent to both Gods. Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms. Athena, ever cautious with lives, goes to battle without eagerness, but solemn necessity, for the Goddess of Wisdom knows honor is for the living. The dead have no need of it.

Keeper of Time
BOT_desc
Existence is measured in age. How many years has a mortal lived? What was the construction date of the Parthenon? When were the cosmos formed? Time begins at birth, at creation. But, inevitably, time for all things comes to an end.\n\nExcept, of course, time itself.\n\nBearer of the clock of eternity, rimmed by signs of the Zodiac, the Keeper of Time, Chronos, counts every tick of the second hand, preventing interference with that essential forward momentum.\n\nIf he knows who or when the eternal clock was wound, Chronos does not tell, but upon the first stroke, he came to be. Emptiness was the ocean, then, and his only companion was Ananke, Queen of Fate. Together, their powers divided the vastness into heaven and earth and sea and sky. Thereafter, Chronos became an observer, the watchman of infinity.\n\nPatient to a fault, Chronos knows no urgency. He does not fear pain, or war, or death, for he is time itself and will outlast all. For this reason, his presence on the field of battle is alarming. This war between Gods must portend a conclusion so dire as to threaten the very existence of time. Perhaps, all the Gods should begin counting the seconds of the eternal clock. There may be few of them remaining.

Older Defender Of Olympus
item_name
When Isis was born, she was a Goddess. When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.\n\nFrom the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.\n\nIsis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.\n\nFleeing Set's wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set's rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.\n\nHer bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end. This time, it may not be her husband torn asunder, but all the world, and even the Goddess of Magic may not have the power to reassemble it from oblivion.

BOT_name
the Demon Queller
BOT_desc
In this world resides powerful evil, intent on destroying everything crafted by Gods and Men. Without guardians of equal strength, all would have fallen long ago. Zhong Kui was once a man with ambitions no greater than scholastic excellence, but in death became the perfect shield against evil's onslaught.\n\nZhong Kui sought to pit his brilliant mind against the Imperial Examinations, tests to select councilors for the Emperor. With ease, he passed, but when the emperor saw his hideous face, he cast the scholar out. Offended, furious, Zhong Kui hurled himself repeatedly at the palace gates until his body was broken.\n\nFor his crime, Zhong Kui's soul was judged by the King of Hell, but where the Emperor saw only ugliness, the King of Hell saw potential armed with genius. Zhong Kui was appointed Lord of Demons, tasked to forever hunt and ensnare the evils of the world.\n\nFor centuries, home owners and shopkeepers have adorned their buildings with Zhong Kui's likeness, for that visage that once horrified the emperor now glares with purpose at unwelcome demons. Yet these days, it is not just shops and homes in peril, but the whole world. It does not take a mind like Zhong Kui's to see evil's hand in this War of the Gods. The time has come to bring these demons to task, and Zhong Kui means to smite them all.

Not always born in the crucible of creation, sometimes Gods ascend by tragic happenstance. Such is the tale of Chang'e, Goddess of the Moon.\n\nAmong the immortals that lived in the Heavens, Chang'e was the most elegant dancer, like a dove on windswept currents. She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.\n\nYet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang'e were made mortal.\n\nChang'e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang'e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it. Too much for one person, the Elixir gave her immortality, but it also swept her into the sky.\n\nSince then, Chang'e has lived on the moon, forbidden to see her husband, a Jade Rabbit her only companion. Yet, the Earth is once again in peril, and Chang'e finds herself upon the mortal surface. Perhaps, this is a second chance. If only she can save the world without angering the Jade Emperor, she can at last reunite with her husband.

item_name
Tyr. The embodiment of mankind's impossible ideals. Man is a malleable creature, but a God is stone, shaped only by the harsh weather of expectation. And none have a greater burden of expectation than Tyr, for he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.\n\nCourage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face the frightening.\n\nFenrir, the mighty wolf, was foretold to wreak such devastation on the Gods that they sought to bind him. Tyr, clothed in courage, brought the beast to their prison, where the Gods prepared shackles.\n\nHonor is not a stubborn oath, but the integrity to uphold what is right, even when it is not easy.\n\nUnder the guise of a test of strength, twice the Gods bound Fenrir, and twice he broke free. On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.\n\nJustice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.\n\nBound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr's hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.\n\nOne handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible. As the cloud of war blackens the world, and fear grips the people, Tyr is stooped by the weight of expectation. With blade in hand, he takes the field. For he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.

Inevitably, all mortals must die. They cling to life with fevered desperation, for death is a cold unknown, filled with uncertainty and bleak, everlasting finality. Some accept fate with grace, others are dragged, kicking and screaming, though in truth, no mortal would go to Hades willingly. They are reaped by the nightmarish God of Death, whose grim visage strikes strange against the gleeful satisfaction he feels at performing his work. Thanatos is the very face of death.\n\nYet, to Thanatos, Mortals are easy prey. Their end is preordained, harvesting them but a game to pass the eons, but a God, a being beyond the mortal coil, now there is a creature Thanatos eyes with greedy longing. He despises the immortality other Gods covet. To him, it is a perversion and defiance of his very purpose.\n\nBut can a God truly die? As the Heavens clash and immortal blood spills on the Earth, Thanatos hungers to find out. War is but the preamble to death, a battlefield of souls rent from their bodies, listlessly waiting to be taken by the God of Death. A war between Gods, a war of this magnitude can mean only one thing. Thanatos is about to be very, very busy.

Game_Tip_title
Mercurial. A word that evokes volatility, quickness, and cunning. But to compare anything to the speed and wit of the Messenger God Mercury would be to compare a hot day to the searing forge of Vulcan, or a blooming rose to the glory of Venus. It is but a pale comparison. Mercury can leap the space between lightning and thunder, outfox the fox king, and reach tomorrow before the sun.\n\nAs an infant, Mercury escaped the watchful eye of his half-brother, Apollo, stole his cattle, fashioned a lyre from a tortoise shell, and snuck in a nap, all before Apollo found him missing. His father, Jupiter, found the child's mischief boisterously entertaining, and awarded him the task of delivering messages for the Gods, traveling between the Heavens, the Earth, and even to the depths of the Underworld.\n\nNow war looms and Mercury races to keep the lines of communication open, though he is often caught in the thick of battle. No stranger to combat, he once slew the monster Argus, the demon with one hundred watchful eyes, using speed and guile alone. But this war is different. The foes are stronger, the stakes higher, and Mercury a pivotal cog in the machine. Should he fail to deliver even a single order the balance could tip, and the time left for this world would be truly mercurial.
BOT_lore
Warrior, rebel, trickster, monk, Sun Wukong is known by many titles in the East, yet it was a Journey to the West that made him a hero.\n\nIn his youth, Sun Wukong gained leadership of the monkey tribes, learned secret arts and spells from a Taoist monk, and acquired the legendary Ruyi Jingu Bang from Ao Kuang, a staff that could change size according to his whim. He defied death itself by wiping his name from the Book of Life and Death, and united many of the other monster tribes who sought to ally with him, an act that garnered the attention of the Jade Emperor.\n\nIn an effort to better control the Monkey-King, the Jade Emperor awarded him a title, but when Sun Wukong discovered his new position was little more than 
 stable boy
  he grew angry and declared himself 
 Great Sage, Equal of Heaven,
  and waged war on the heavens. For this treasonous act, he was finally captured and imprisoned beneath a mountain for five centuries.\n\nAt long last, the humble monk Xuanzang was seeking disciples to protect him while on his legendary Journey to the West to collect the Indian Sutras. Sun Wukong gladly agreed to serve him, but the Buddha wrapped a golden circlet around the Monkey King's head so that Xuanzang could control him. With three other disciples, they faced eighty one trials during their quest, and collected the sutras. For his service and strength, Sun Wukong was awarded Buddhahood, finally ascending to heaven and gaining immortality.\n\nWith an epic battle between Gods taking place, Sun Wukong's presence is all but assured.

Nu Wa
BOT_name
Guardian of Heaven
BOT_desc
When two warring Gods shattered the World Pillar, Heaven and Earth dangerously shifted, and Armageddon was unleashed. Firestorms, floods, and bloodthirsty monsters ravaged the land and stole the lives of more than can be counted. In ages past, Nu Wa, Guardian of Heaven and Earth, hand-crafted all people from clay. They were her creations, her children, her responsibility.\n\nAs the Earth shuddered and broke, and the skies turned black with ash, Nu Wa forged five mystic stones, one for each of the elemental forces of nature: Earth, Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs, and raced to the broken World Pillar. One leg she used to prop the Heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between Heaven and Earth was restored, but the world was never the same. Skies cleared, but the stars had shifted. Seas retreated, but rivers drained westward. Everything leaned, but the End was averted.\n\nIn the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshipped to this day.\n\nYet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all Pantheons have chosen Earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago. Determined to prevent such calamity from repeating, Nu Wa has summoned the elemental stones once more. For she is the Guardian of Heaven and Earth; all mankind are her creations, her children, her responsibility.

It is said that history is written by the victors, but what happens when the victors say nothing? Everything that came before would be lost. Events, mythology, even identity. The victors 
  the survivors 
  could become anyone. Even Gods. Ah Muzen Cab is suspiciously devoid of a past, but the God of Bees enjoys the privileges of worship and ceremony. Privileges that, perhaps, he stole.\n\nLong ago, the sky was propped above the land by four beings, the Bacab. They endured their task without complaint, and for their service, were honored by the Mudmen beneath. In truth, the Bacab were prisoners, shackled by duty. Then, a great flood consumed the earth. Seizing their chance, the Bacab fled and the sky crashed into the rising sea. Into that terrible storm they vanished, never to be seen again.\n\nAs the seas retreated, new Bacab stepped in to hold the sky aloft. The land reemerged, and from it mankind was born. Gods appeared; patrons of the sustaining forces of life, like agriculture and fertility. And the bee, creator of honey, used to sweeten food, as medicine for the sick, and to produce mead for rituals, was revered, and Ah Muzen Cab arrived, as if from nowhere, as their God.\n\nNow, as the greatest war between the heavens clashes on earth, what will remain when the dust has settled? Who will be the victor that writes history? If Ah Muzen Cab was, indeed, one of the original four Bacab, he survived the end of the world once and became a God. What power will he seize this time when the new world is made?

Tutorial Invuln Volume
item_name
To speak of Kali is to speak of the beginning of time itself.\n\nAcross the majestic lands of Hindustan rose an army of demons that conquered the countryside and slaughtered the people. Yet, when the Gods themselves were defeated, Devi, the supreme Goddess, emerged to throw back this host and protect the faithful.\n\nThree forms she took during these ancient times. The first, Durga, the Mother of Creation, was as radiant as she was fearsome. Astride her tiger, she scattered the demon horde until she encountered the horrendous Raktabija. For each wound she gave the demon, his cursed blood created a copy, quickly resulting in an unstoppable army of Raktabija clones. Rage boiled at the corners of Durga's mind, in the quest to slaughter and destroy evil. From the forehead of Durga sprung her wrathful form, with skin darkened and eyes glowing a menacing red.\n\nThus was Kali, the Black One, Goddess of Time and Destruction, the second form of Devi born.\n\nRarely has Kali been seen since, kept in the shadows of Devi's mind, but when the tides of battle shift and evil looms large, there is no solution but unrestrained destruction of evil, and Kali once again, walks the Earth.

Rain is life. Showers from above soak the earth, feeding seeds which grow into precious fruits and grains. Man and beast alike are sustained by this cycle. Without rain, this world would be barren and all living things would turn to dust. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain. But, like all great power, it did not come without cost.\n\nIn mankind's earliest days there were no farmers, so they starved beneath the sun. For days, Chaac sought a way to feed them. Deep in the mountains he discovered a golden boulder and cleft it with his mighty axe. Within was Maize, the crop that would change the Mayan people forever, and Chaac was worshipped and adored for it.\n\nDrunk with pride, Chaac sought the object of his deepest desire, the wife of his brother. For a time, their affair remained secret, but that was not to last. Chaac's brother, the Sun God, discovered them. Without a word, she dutifully returned to her husband and Chaac, realizing what he had done, let her go, but a rift formed between the two brothers that would never heal. In his grief, Chaac drove his axe into the sky, and from the wound tears of regret fell.\n\nSince then, Chaac has chosen a life free of pride and selfishness, devoting himself only to mankind. As a reminder of his greatest failing, he continues to cleave the heavens, washing the land in sustaining waters. Thus do crops grow. Thus do the people survive. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain.

Behold the rumble from the deep, for it is the bellow of rock and stone. A titan of immortal ages has awoken from fitful slumber to crush all who tread upon his realm. A lumbering giant, patient, deliberate, unmovable; he is Geb, God of Earth.\n\nWhen a mortal's heart is weighed in the halls of Ma'at, Geb sits among the Gods in judgment. Those burdened with guilt and regret are claimed by Geb and dragged through the earthen crust to the underworld. Hearts free of such heaviness are taught words of power and ascend to the sky.\n\nAh, the sky.\n\nIt is but the one thing Geb longs for. In his eye, she is glorious sapphire, an unreachable object. But it was not always so. Once, the earth and sky were as one, Geb and Nut, Goddess of the Sky, locked in a lover's embrace. Ra deemed their union unfit and sent Shu, God of Wind, between them. In his rage, Geb thundered and broke the earth, but for naught, Nut was now forever out of reach.\n\nThough his desire has not weathered with the ages, Geb has rested peacefully for time immemorial, nurturing Mankind through bountiful harvest and stable ground for pyramids and palaces. It is the clash of Gods upon his surface that stirs him. He has risen to war, though his motives are unclear. Does he fight to prevent the destruction of his realm, or will he seize the chance to shatter the wind and reunite the earth and sky? Whatever the outcome, the earth will always remain.

Of arrogance and pride, the Greeks have but one word: hubris. It is a crime against Gods and Men, but a crime many commit with impunity. Even mighty Zeus is guilty. But when punishment is due, there is one from whom even the God of Thunder shrinks. She is Nemesis, the red-washed blade of Divine Retribution.\n\nRecall the tale of Narcissus, so taken by his own beauty. Proudly, his visage was flaunted, to the detriment of all. Until, at last, he was led to a pond of crystal hue where his own reflection enraptured him. So long did he remain to gaze upon this self-image that hunger claimed his life. Thus does Nemesis respond to hubris. It is consequence equal to the crime.\n\nNow, behold the war torn land, beset by the wrath of wanton Gods filling the air with blood and boasts. This battlefield is stained with hubris. Unwittingly, these foolish warriors have summoned their greatest adversary. Nemesis has come!\n\nNo longer will foul deeds engender success, no hoard of wealth held in undeserving hands, no legends told when falsely earned. Nemesis will unleash a tide of retribution. Punishment for the crime of hubris is death.

Horror of the Sea
BOT_desc
Ancient poems warn of a narrow channel of water so treacherous that death touches all who approach. Sailors must choose to risk their ship, traveling close to the monstrous whirlpool Charybdis, or instead hug the rocky shoals where dwells a creature some say is made from the nightmares of all men.\n\nScylla, they call her, Horror of the Sea. No ship that dares sail in her waters goes unscathed. Those that cling to survival whisper panicked tales of enormous black tentacles tipped with slavering hound heads ravaging whole ships to splinters with pitiless precision. Though it's her laughter, they say, that's most horrible; child-like, delighting in blood soaked murder as men are dragged into the dark abyss.\n\nPoets have tried to romanticize this beast, to provide some humanity to her monstrosity. They write she was once a beautiful Naiad, wronged by a jealous priestess and transformed. Yet the old poems say she was born this way, beget by gods full of jealousy and loathing; dropped into the sea to terrorize mankind.\n\nWould that she had remained in the sea, but the nightmare has come ashore. Dragged by dog-headed tentacles she roams our streets, plucks us from our beds, and fills the night with disturbing laughter. Scylla has come, and not even the gods can help us.

Origin
ITEM_name
Amongst the snow-capped forests of the frigid north resides the hunter-God of Glory, Ullr. Reserved, secretive, Ullr does not represent the tankard downing, boast bellowing contemporaries of the Norse Pantheon, but pays respectful tribute to glory in all its forms.\n\nGlory is in the silence of snowfall, in the honorable victory earned from single combat, in the perfect curve of a yew bow firing an arrow true. Dotted across the lands of the Faithful, shrines to Ullr can be found in remote, secluded hideaways. It is there that glory is found in the sanctity of a vow, once sworn, never broken, and bound by a ring, no matter how crude, then buried in the earth to weather the ages of time.\n\nThough rarely spoken of, he is highly regarded, even among the Gods, for it is Ullr, not one of Odin's sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the All Father is away. Other Gods might use the opportunity to abuse the power, but Ullr's rule is merely an extension thereof. So much so that only the innermost circle even know that Odin is gone.\n\nAll the more noticeable is it, then, that Ullr has abandoned this post to join the fray. Early on did Odin take the field of battle, leaving Ullr to manage the kingdom. So great a threat must this war be as to endanger the very survival of Asgard. Whatever the reason, Ullr comes to preserve glory, which, for him, may be the whole world.

item_name
Do you hear it? That distant rumble like thunder across the mountains? Like pitched battle from miles away? Like a stampede of elephants across the plains? Know it is none of these things. That rumble you hear is the bellowing snore of Kumbhakarna, the Sleeping Giant.\n\nQuick with a laugh, honest with friends, but devastating in battle, Kumbhakarna embodies the traits of a hero, but loyalty to his tyrant brother, Ravana, often leads him to the wrong side.\n\nSo jovial and pious is he, that when granted a boon by Brahma, Kumbhakarna wished to take Indra's place and rule the Heavens. Indra was jealously threatened, convinced Brahma would let the good-natured giant usurp him, and magically twisted Kumbhakarna's tongue at the last second. Instead of asking for 
 Indraasana
  (Indra's Seat), he asked for 
 Nidraasana,
  ... to sleep.\n\nNow, Kumbhakarna is a dozing behemoth, waking only once every six months. Yet, Ravana is concerned with the growing fervor of the battle between gods and demons, sensing his dominion slipping. Prematurely, he has awoken his brother and pressed him to fight. Though reluctant, as if he knows his brother's stance is unjust, Kumbhakarna fights out of loyalty and a warrior's code.\n\nNow, that rumbling you hear, it is not his snores, but Kumbhakarna's mighty roar. Or was that a yawn?

Broken God of the Afterlife
BOT_desc
Never has there been, nor shall there be a king more perfect than Osiris. Son of the Earth God, Geb, Osiris was divine royalty by birth, and all the land his birthright. Benevolence and prosperity were the hallmarks of his reign. Would that he had been left to shape the world, but the jealousy of his brother, Set, changed the course of fate.\n\nSeeking to usurp the throne, Set deceived and murdered his brother, tearing his body to pieces and casting them across the land. Isis, Osiris' wife, secretly fled while Set plunged the kingdom into darkness. For years she toiled to reassemble her husband while his spirit form, his Ba, endured. Yet for all her searching, she could not find every part of him, and Isis was forced to reanimate Osiris without. Though not strong enough to defy Set in this incomplete form, Osiris gave Isis a son that would topple the tyrant Set and restore balance to Egypt.\n\nWhat remains of Osiris is a fragment of what he once was. Robbed of his crown over the earth, he now governs the realm of the dead with the same benevolence he ruled the living. But darkness looms again, and though broken, Osiris refuses to sit idly by. Mustering the last of his strength and spirit, Osiris seeks to change the course of fate, this time for the light over darkness.

Many fear change. Venturing into the unknown. Deviating from a path of safety and certainty into something unexpected. But life is change; a journey through doorways both physical and emotional, with every moment a passage to something new, and it is Janus, God of Portals and Transitions that governs this.\n\nBearing two faces, Janus is ever looking to the future and to the past, knowing both but controlling neither. He is only the in-between, found in the changing of seasons, at the birth of a child, at the entrances to the temple and the tavern. For this reason the Romans named the first month after him: January 
  a portal between the old year and the new.\n\nYet the Roman emperors also attribute a strange tradition to Janus. At each end of his temple stand massive doors. In times of peace, these doors are closed, but in times of war, flung open. As Rome rose to power, rarely were these doors shut, but almost four hundred years of peace have clothed Rome since then and the temple has grown dusty with absence. These days, however, the doors are open once more. It seems war has returned, and the greatest of changes are upon us.

With his horde of undying minions, all who stand in his way will be made to surrender their crystals or perish. Unless the noble Champions of the Realm can come together to defeat him, Jurassic Ted will smite this land into oblivion. Also, he has cookies. Mmmm, cookies.
BOT_lore
Tragodar has come to warn the Champions of the impending return of Jurassic Ted, his former master. Because Jurassic Ted is immortal, the only way to defeat him is to go back in time and prevent the acursed necromancer from creating him in the first place. Unbeknowst to our heroes, Tragodar's true intentions are to go back and enslave Jurassic Ted, instead using him to conquer the galaxy and make cookies illegal across all of time and space.

Welcome to the Basic Tutorial, Champion. I will be guiding you through your Paladins training.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_010
First off, look at the door on the left in front of you.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_020
Excellent.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_030
Now, look at the door on the right.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_040
Well done.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_050
Now, let's go over movement.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_060
You can move forwards and backwards based on the direction you're looking.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_070
You can also move left and right.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_080
Excellent.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_090
For the next part of your training, I will need some assistance.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_100
Excellent. Follow Ying to the next area.
Tutorial_A_PortalRoom_110
Move to the highlighted area.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_060
Let's begin combat training. First, let me walk through some information on your screen.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_070
You will find your Health displayed on your screen. If your health reaches 0, you die.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_080
Your primary weapon is your Assault Rifle.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_110
Aim the crosshairs in the middle of the screen over the target, then fire.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_130
Ying will create one of her illusions for you to shoot 
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_120
Note the red outline around the illusions. This means they are enemies.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_160
Well done.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_140
Ying will now create a few more illusions for you to destroy.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_150
Some weapons have a limited amount of ammo, like your Assault Rifle.  When ammo runs out, they must be reloaded in order to fire again
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_170
Great work!
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_180
One more to go!
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_190
Excellent. Now, let's go over your abilities.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_200
Your first ability allows you to throw a Frag Grenade.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_210
Now, launch your Frag Grenade to hit all targets in the area.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_220
Try again!
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_230
Well done!
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_240
Note that you will have to wait a short time before using that ability again.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_250
This Cooldown time is displayed over the ability icon.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_260
Your next ability is Hustle.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_270
Move forward, then activate Hustle to move even faster.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_280
Nice. Your next ability is Iron Sights.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_290
Hold down Iron Sights to aim down the sights of your weapon.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_300
Using Iron Sights is a great way to target enemies farther away.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_310
Nice shooting.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_320
Now, let's go over your ultimate ability: Barrage.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_330
Your ultimate ability is your most powerful ability, and can turn a fight in your favor.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_340
You must fully charge your ultimate ability before you can use it.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_350
The current charge level of your ultimate is displayed on top of the ability icon.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_360
You charge your ultimate by dealing damage to enemy players.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_370
Now, let's charge your ultimate. Shoot the targets to build up ultimate charge.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_380
Your ultimate is 50% charged.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_390
Your ultimate is almost fully charged.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_400
Your ultimate ability Barrage is now fully charged.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_410
When Barrage is active, aim in the direction of an enemy and fire to trigger a blast.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_420
You will call in a succession of strikes down on the targets that are in your sight range during Barrage.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_430
After a delay, the strike will come down and hit at the location of the target.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_440
I'll charge Barrage again so you can try once more.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_450
Excellent work. Ying's done helping us, bye Ying!
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_460
Now it's time to customize your loadout.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_470
Excellent. Now select a loadout of cards.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_010
Let's try changing loadouts to your second loadout.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_020
Well done.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_030
In addition to loadouts, you will also be able to select Items to empower your Champion or counter an enemy's strategy.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_040
Open the Item menu now.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_050
You'll need credits in order to purchase Items. Credits are earned throughout the match for various actions like dealing damage.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_060
Let me give you some credits.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_070
There. Let's try buying your first Item.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_080
Excellent. Now try upgrading your item.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_085
Note that you may have only one item from each category, though you can buy multiple Items.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_090
You are limited with how many Items you may buy. Let's try buying additional items now.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_100
It looks like you are ready to move on.
Tutorial_C_PortalRoom2_110
Some matches will have multiple rounds. At the beginning of a round, an objective will become active and will be indicated by a directional marker on your screen.
Tutorial_D_Objective_012
The match will start when the countdown reaches 0.
Tutorial_D_Objective_015
When leaving the spawn room you will be mounted to get back to the action faster.
Tutorial_D_Objective_018
Head to the objective now.
Tutorial_D_Objective_020
When you encounter certain obstacles, you can clear them by jumping.
Tutorial_D_Objective_022
If you take damage while mounted, you will be dismounted. You can also dismount by taking an action.
Tutorial_D_Objective_025
If you avoid combat for a short period of time, your health will start to regenerate.
Tutorial_D_Objective_028
Objectives are marked by a pedestal on the ground.
Tutorial_D_Objective_030
To capture it, move inside the area.
Tutorial_D_Objective_040
While you are within the area, you make progress towards capturing the objective for your team.
Tutorial_D_Objective_050
Current capture progress is displayed on your screen.
Tutorial_D_Objective_060
Continue capturing the objective
Tutorial_D_Objective_065
Notice that you are gaining Credits as you capture the objective.
Tutorial_D_Objective_070
Watch out! An enemy is trying to contest the objective. When champions from both teams are on the objective, neither team will gain capture progress.
Tutorial_D_Objective_080
That enemy came from the Stealth Grass. Champions inside the stealth grass cannot be seen from the outside until they take action.
Tutorial_D_Objective_090
Well done. Once an objective has been captured, your team will earn points and a Payload cart will spawn.
Tutorial_D_Objective_100
Your team must escort the Payload cart to the enemy base to earn additional points towards winning the game.
Tutorial_D_Objective_110
The Payload cart can only progress towards the enemy base when you are standing near it.
Tutorial_D_Objective_120
Escort the Payload cart to the checkpoint.
Tutorial_D_Objective_130
Enemy players can halt the Payload progress by standing near it as well.
Tutorial_D_Objective_140
Destroy the target to continue progressing the Payload.
Tutorial_D_Objective_150
Excellent. Continue pushing the Payload.
Tutorial_D_Objective_160
Well done. You have completed your basic combat training.
Tutorial_D_Objective_170
When you encounter certain obstacles, you can clear them by jumping.
Tutorial_B_BasicTraining_020

Pip Lore
ITEM_name
Unlike most other vulpin, Pip chose to specialize in weaponized explosives instead of curative alchemy. He left Brightmarsh, his homeland, in search of adventure across the Realm. Now he splits his time between brewing up all sorts of fiery concoctions to use against the Magistrate's forces and creating restorative potions to aid his friends. While his allies have come to appreciate his assistance and expertise, they fully understand that the little fox is as unpredictable as he is dangerous.

Jenos Lore
ITEM_name
Originally climbing the mountain to escape the ravages of the Second Scourge many generations ago, Jenos was merely a young monk in search of a greater wisdom. After finding it written among the stars, he ascended into the heavens, vanishing for years but leaving behind a small group of followers dedicated to carrying on his legacy. Now, as the Realm descends into war once again, so too has Jenos descended from the stars to walk upon the ground once again, joining the battle for some arcane purpose only he understands.

Lex Lore
ITEM_name
The Outer Tribunal is made up of merciless, oathbound judges, none more dedicated than Lex. He and his partner, Androxus, traveled the fringes of the Realm together, tracking down infamous criminals and battling all manner of horrors on behalf of the Magistrate. After encountering a sinister goddess, though, Androxus abandoned his duties and quickly rose to the top of the most wanted list. Lex, unable to turn his back on the law or the Magistrate, vowed to one day take his former partner in, dead or alive.

Vivian Lore
ITEM_name
Rapidly rising through the ranks of the Magistrate, Vivian's clever, persistent scheming got her appointed to the Deepwerks facility, where she was the first to recognize the military potential of the research they were conducting. In the swirling chaos of the war with the Paladins, she sees only the opportunity to advance her station in life. Equipped with some of the most advanced crystal-powered weaponry ever created, she joined the battle not to prove herself or follow orders, but to silence the lone witness of her true plans.

ITEM_name
The soul of the forest isn't an invisible spirit or comforting poem about being one with nature, it's an angry walking tree with a huge stone axe. After decades of peaceful slumber since the last time Grover had to walk the land and help put down the goblin scourge, he has awoken once again to find the forests of the Realm threatened by the spread of humanoid civilization, rampant industrialization, and the fires of war. Hoisting his trusty axe, he stomps into battle once again, intent on destroying anything and anyone who would harm the natural world.

Once a noble lawman of the Outer Tribunal circuit judges, Androxus and his former partner, Lex, were relentless in their pursuit of criminals and threats to the natural order. After a tragic confrontation with a deceitful goddess, though, he became afflicted with an otherworldly disease dooming him with an endless hunger for souls. Now he wanders the realm adrift to feed that hunger, stripped of his rank and duties with the Tribunal, and condemned to live with the curse for all time.

Ash made a name for herself in the Magistrate army by volunteering for front-line duty using experimental heavy armor and siege weaponry. Lacking finesse or subtlety, she more than makes up for it with brutal tactics and overkill. The War Machine, as she is called by her allies and enemies alike, earned the title every time the dust settled and she was all that remained on the scorched battlefield. When the Resistance emerged and brought the war to Crosswind Hold, Ash led the charge against them with fury and determination.

Long before he came to the Deepwerks and helped develop the crystal-powered technology spreading throughout the Realm, Barik was a clever inventor and resourceful engineer. Since then, his signature contributions have appeared in almost every field and vocation, from mechanized mining suits and rocket-powered wings to the crystalline weapons used by Magistrate and Resistance soldiers alike. After a falling out with the corrupt Magistrate commander assigned to oversee the security of the Deepwerks, he left and pledged his services to Valera and the Paladins.

How are bomb's born?
ITEM_short_desc
During a fortress siege long ago, a clever warlord decided that the best way to breach her enemy's defenses was by creating walking bombs. Her warlock accidentally brought one of the larger bombs to life, creating the Bomb King. After destroying her entire army himself, Bomb King struck out on his own delusional quest to visit all the lands under his rule. The common folk know better than to offend or even stand very close to him, as his regal demeanor can instantly change to furious, explosive rage at any moment.

What the Buck
ITEM_short_desc
Buck's story is just as diverse and complicated as his fighting style, as one is the direct result of the other. Pulling from those experiences, he effectively combines the self-discipline of a devout monk, clever ambushes commonly used by underworld thugs, and the tactics and weaponry of a front-line soldier. Once a loyal member of the Magistrate's own elite fighting group he has now returned to where it all began, Crosswind Hold, to join the Resistance in their struggle against the Magistrate.

Watching all her friends leave the Greenwood to join the fight against the Magistrate, Cassie lamented the curse that bound her bloodline to her family's homeland. When a mysterious oracle offered her an escape from her obligations, she jumped at the chance, even though she knew the sacrifice she made would haunt her. Taking nothing but her father's enchanted crossbow and her faithful hunting bird, Zigs, she raced off to join the Paladins in their resistance against the draconian Magistrate.

Born wingless as a mere wyrin underling to a vicious dragon, Drogoz escaped his servitude using a pair of crystal-fueled mechanical wings crafted by a clever dwarven engineer. The draconic blood in his veins pulsed with cruelty and greed, sending him on a Realm-wide rampage of destruction as he amassed his own horde, one that would rival that of the true dragons. As the war rages, Drogoz streaks through the sky above, swooping down to deal with his foes as quickly and violently as possible.

After cleverly tricking and imprisoning a great frost elemental in a magical gemstone, Evie went from apprentice sorceress to winter witch overnight. Though no longer welcome in her home village, which she left to an uncertain fate, she found her talents to be in high demand in the war against the Magistrate. Her true motivations are as mysterious as the exact details of her background, though, causing her allies to question her loyalty as well as how long she can really hope to keep the vengeful elemental contained.

Though not of noble birth nor having any real combat training, Fernando assumed the mantle of knighthood when the knight he served met an untimely fate. From that moment on, he wandered from one heroic adventure to the next, making a name for himself throughout the Realm. When the Magistrate called on all loyal houses to join their efforts against the Resistance, he heeded their summons with pride. If his valor in combat and charming confidence can keep his allies from discovering his secret, he might just live to become the champion he knows he can be.

Being struck by lightning once is usually more than enough to kill someone, but after dozens of strikes, Grohk was still standing. Though it took a while to realize Grohk had been imbued with the power to control the lightning itself, he put it to good use defending his tribe from a goblin attack that would have otherwise destroyed them. Seeing his power as a sign from the weather spirits, the rest of the Red River orcs immediately appointed him their chieftain. When the Realm erupted into civil war, he sensed another storm brewing and joined the battle on behalf of his tribe.

One of the few remaining stagalla, Inara was reluctant but oath-bound to join the Paladins in their time of need. Originally created to help the ancient order repel the First Scourge of goblin encroachment, the stone people slumbered for generations before being summoned to battle once again. Inara was slow to act, but after witnessing the atrocities committed by the Magistrate, she threw herself into the fight on behalf of the Resistance, heeding the call of Valera and the Paladins once again.

As a young recruit in the elite Sentinels unit, Kinessa took to her sniper lessons with an eagerness and enthusiasm that surprised her mentors. Frustrated by the rigors of military life, she left before she could complete her training and struck out on her own. As the Realm descended into chaos and war, vigilante bounty contracts were plentiful, earning her all the fame and fortune she'd lacked while in the service of the Magistrate. She refuses to pick a side in the conflict, though, because it's much more profitable to contract with both than commit to either.

After plotting to set herself up as the legitimate heiress to the Ruby Throne, nothing stood in Lian's way. Her sincere dedication to her family's legacy may have earned her the title of Scion, but her skill with the rifle is what won her the respect of her family's Royal Guard. When the Magistrate called on all loyal houses to unite against the Resistance, she was honor-bound to accept, arriving from her far-off homeland to represent House Aico along with her faithful bodyguard and general, Khan.

After making a name for herself as a skilled thief and knife-fighter, the half-tigron Maeve decided to join the war for personal gain, selling her services to the highest bidder. She dashes from shadow to shadow with unnatural agility, concealed by her magical longcoat, a souvenir from one of her most daring burglaries: the Magistrate's fortress keep. While her employers find her talents useful, they often complain of suspiciously misplaced valuables and lost coins after she moves on to the next fight.

Once the dedicated protector of an island home of the Ska'drin, the ancient Makoa has now been summoned to wage war against the Magistrate on the mainland. Though he hopes to one day return to the islands, he fears that the unappeased volcanoes will rend them asunder in his absence. In the meantime, however, he brings both the fury of the ocean and the indomitable resilience of the tortoise spirit, as well as various naval implements, to bear against those who would defile the natural world.

When Wekono, the Mother of Sorrow and Revenge, turns her gaze to the mortal world, she appoints a champion. In this cycle, the island witchdoctor Mal'Damba has been gifted with her powers and sent into the war to evangelize her faith by laying waste to any who would stand before him. His mastery of dark magic and virulent poisons was already impressive before the insidious goddess imbued him with even greater abilities, rendering him one of the deadliest beings in the Realm, an extension of Wekono's will.

While toiling in the gold mines, a particularly wily and inventive goblin named Ruckus stumbled upon the long-lost mind-stone of a fallen war golem. He installed the relic into his mechanical digging suit, hoping it would provide the suit with enough power to outperform the other miners. But he was surprised when the ancient sentience reawakened and brought the suit to life. Though it resented its situation, its pilot, and the name it was given, Bolt nonetheless agreed to a tentative partnership, one that freed them both to scour the Realm in search of fame, fortune, and upgrades.

Tales of the legendary adventurer Sha Lin have spread far and wide across the Realm, recounting his heroic exploits and death-defying antics. During his short lifetime, he's already helped topple warlords, recovered long-lost artifacts, and betrayed the infamous Thousand Hands guild. He's broken as many hearts with his magical longbow as he has with his silver tongue, but even he has a stake in the current conflict between the Magistrate and the Resistance, standing up to the oppressive Magistrate on behalf of the common folk.

A being from beyond the void, Seris has taken the name of the city she completely destroyed upon first setting foot in the world of the living. Draining the souls of her enemies and occasionally restoring them to her allies, however, pales in comparison to her unnatural prescience, granting her the ability to see into the past and predict the future all at once. She appears here and there in time and space, always at the opportune moment to change the course of events toward some unknown but seemingly inevitable fate.

Noble by birth, Skye abandoned a life of luxury and wealth to pursue her dreams of excitement and adventure. During her time spent on the streets, interacting with the criminal underworld of the Realm, she discovered a natural talent and boundless passion for killing. When her career as a contract assassin brought her fame and fortune, she caught the Magistrate's attention and now serves as one of Grand Magister Karne's closest advisors. To her the War of the Realm is just a long-term contract, one that won't end until the last of the Paladins are dealt with.

Having spent most of his life in the military, Strix was an invaluable member of the Sentinels, tasked with training their elite sharpshooters. He was reassigned after the unit was disbanded, sent to the front lines with the regular army as it prepared to put down the Resistance. Always the calm and composed professional, he is the master of stealth and camouflage, able to pick off high value targets before the enemy is even aware of his presence -- or that they are under attack at all.

Talus might still be young and overly optimistic, but he's got big plans. After almost losing his family to an angry mob that refused to accept the otherworldly Ska'drin as neighbors, he set out on a quest for knowledge. From the shores of an abandoned island paradise to the darkened corridors of the Deepwerks, he uncovered forgotten truths as well as unlocking his inborn aptitude. When the Paladins rose up to oppose the Magistrate, he joined them, eager to put his newfound abilities to work and prove that the Ska'drin deserve a place in the Realm.

Whatever Terminus once was, he has since become an instrument of war fighting on behalf of the Magistrate. His mind and memories are long gone, his broken body bound by dark sorcery and unstable magic crystals. His lifeless yet undying state may be a mere shadow of his former self, but it has also rid him of hesitation and fear. He obediently charges into battle with reckless abandon, hefting a terrifying battle axe that few mortals could lift and even fewer could hope to endure.

As the ranking scholar and preeminent authority on runic lore at the Deepwerks facility, Torvald is one of the architects of the wave of crystal-powered technology sweeping across the Realm. Though he would much rather have his nose buried in a dusty old history tome or reach into a swirling vortex of magical energy using his enhanced stone gauntlet, he understands that the Magistrate is the driving force behind all his research and has joined their effort to put down the Resistance. Once the war is over, he can once more get back to work.

Raised to shoot straight and survive the harsh winters of the frontier, Tyra signed on with the Magistrate army at a young age. After the Sentinels' disastrous final mission, she returned to her homeland to make a living tracking down the monstrous threats to the common folk that lurked beyond the fringes of the Realm. Her unyielding stamina and pinpoint accuracy with the rifle serve her well in her new role: helping the Resistance fight back against the Magistrate and bring an end to the war that rages across the Realm.

Why does he die so much
ITEM_short_desc
The former commander of the Sentinels, an elite Magistrate military unit, Viktor lives in the shadow of his former glory. He took the blame for what happened during their final mission, was stripped of his rank, and reassigned to a lower position by Grand Magister Karne. His training and skill as a soldier remains unparalleled, though, along with his unwavering loyalty to the Magistrate. Determined to regain his standing, he pushes himself well beyond his limits in battle against the Resistance, striving to end the rebellion before it picks up any further momentum.

What do Faeries eat?
ITEM_short_desc
Though short-lived and even-tempered, the faeries of the Summer Court wage an endless war against the encroachment of modern civilization. Willo might only have three summers to her name, but her aggressive demeanor more than make up for her lack of experience. She charges into the fray with an eagerness and tenacity that worries the precious few remaining faeries. At a time when the fae should be regrouping to bolster their dwindling numbers, Willo has taken it upon herself to attack both the Magistrate and the Resistance against them.

Ying is heartless
ITEM_short_desc
A talented young spellcaster, Ying is a master of illusions and trickery, able to befuddle her opponents with bewildering misdirection. That same magic can also soothe the minds of her allies to ease their suffering and mend their wounds. She made good use of those skills to escape imprisonment by a bandit king and during her days as an adventurer afterward. When the Magistrate began its campaign of conquest, subjugating the Realm in an attempt to restrict the use of magic by the common folk, she felt it was her responsibility to join the fight against the tyranny.

Zhin is an artist
ITEM_short_desc
Robbed of his noble lineage, Zhin ruthlessly carved out his own throne atop of the criminal underworld. By the time he was a man, he'd won the loyalty of enough thieves, assassins, and corrupt bureaucrats to build his own shadowy empire: the Thousand Hands guild. Anyone scheming against him had a way of vanishing in the middle of the night, while those who confronted him directly met their doom at the end of his wicked flaming sword. He refuses to pick a side in the war, as there's more profit to be made playing them against each other.

ITEM_name
While the rest of the rabbit-like leipori fled to the forests to avoid getting involved in the war raging across the Realm, Moji took it upon herself to summon the great nature spirits to defend the world. She charges into battle atop her trusty familiar, Po-Li, who carries her through the fray as she unleashes a maelstrom of sorcerous destruction on her enemies. Once the war is over and the Realm has returned to its natural state, she hopes to return to the forest and help her people begin the healing process, restoring all that was lost.

Khan XP
ITEM_name
The Patriarch of House Aico issued a challenge to his captains: hold the house's banner for as long as possible. Few were strong enough to last a day. The last captain to receive the test, a young man named Khan, held the banner for hours. As his arms tired, he beckoned to a common servant and asked her to take it from him. 
 Even though I must fall,
  he said, 
 the banner will remain.
  This was no test of strength, but one of loyalty to House Aico. Khan passed the test and proved himself worthy of command. Today, he serves Lian as advisor and protector.

Once, a nameless street rat challenged the tyrant Zhin. For the boy's remarkable skills, Zhin granted him a new life in the Thousands Hands Guild, and a new name: Koga. The Guild was Koga's family and he became their finest ninja. But not all families get along. Jealous lies spread, false evidence was planted, and Zhin's fury forced Koga to flee. Now the exiled ninja fights for his new family -- The Paladins -- as he searches for the one who betrayed him.

ITEM_name
Admiral Dredge ruled the eight oceans as the Realm's most feared pirate, until one final treasure led to his doom. Dredge stole the Warders' relics from the Paladins, but could not tame the dragons' might. His ship was destroyed, his crew scattered, and Dredge sank to certain death in the ocean's depths. The Abyss intervened and bore Dredge back into the Realm of the living. Now the undead admiral sails the seas again. And none will take his treasure.
